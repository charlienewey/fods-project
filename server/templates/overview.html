        There are a number of areas around the world renowned for the quality of their wine, and chief among these are several regions in France; Bordeaux, Burgundy, Southern Rhone, and Northern Rhone. The reputation of these areas is reflected in the price of wine produced in each, with the best bottles costing many hundreds of pounds. This project revolves around collecting various data sets (weather data, data on the state of the global economy, review data, and more) and comparing with the year-on-year price of wine produced in the corresponding region - thus attempting to uncover links between price, investment potential, weather, agricultural output, and so on. Much of this data is available before the wine is bottled (it is cheaper to buy in bulk that way). Thus, the question we will try to answer can be formulated like this;
        </p>

        <p>
        "Can we use data to make inferences about which vintages will be the most profitable, using only data that is available before the wine is bottled?"
        </p>

        <p>
        We will attempt to do this by constructing a web dashboard containing visualisations that will allow the user to explore historical wine prices, historical weather summary statistics (for example, monthly rainfall over a given year), review data, and more.

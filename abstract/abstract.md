# Abstract

There are a number of areas around the world renowned for the quality of their
wine, and among these is the Bordeaux region in France. This reputation is
reflected in the price of wine produced in the area, with the best bottles
costing thousands of pounds. This project will revolve around collecting various
data sets (weather data, agricultural production metrics, and more) and
comparing with the year-on-year price of wine produced in the Bordeaux region -
thus attempting to uncover links between price, investment potential, weather,
agricultural output, and so on. Much of this data is available before the wine
is bottled (it is cheaper to buy in bulk that way). Thus, the question we will
try to answer can be formulated like this;

"Can we use data to make inferences about *which* vintages will be the most
profitable, using only data that is available before the wine is bottled?"

We will attempt to do this by constructing a web dashboard containing
visualisations that will allow the user to explore historical wine prices,
historical weather summary statistics (for example, monthly rainfall over a
given year), and more - and attempting to uncover interesting relationships
and patterns in the data.

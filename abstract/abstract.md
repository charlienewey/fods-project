# Abstract

There are a number of areas around the world renowned for the quality of their wine, and among the
foremost of these is the Bordeaux region in France. This reputation is reflected in the price of
wine produced in the area, with the "best" bottles reaching tens of thousands of pounds each. There
also exists a large (and profitable) market in "investment wines" - that is, wines that will improve
with age, and therefore increase in price (as they also become more scarce over time). This project
will revolve around collecting various data sets (weather data, agricultural production metrics, and
more) and comparing with the year-on-year price of wine produced in the Bordeaux region - thus
attempting to uncover links between price, investment potential, weather, agricultural output, and
more. Wine is cheaper to purchase while it is still being fermented in the barrels, and the French
have a phrase for this - *"en primeur"*.

Thus, the question we will try to answer can be formulated like this;

"Can we use data to make inferences about *which* vintages will be the most profitable, using only
data that is available before the wine is bottled?"
